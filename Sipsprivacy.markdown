This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Sips: Drink with Friends on iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

Sips: Drink with Friends will hereby be referred to as Sips

### Information we collect

Sips does not have access to any names or custom cards that a player enters.  The app only can access the amount of time spent in the app and any purchases made.

### Technical basics

If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We never use notifications for marketing. Notifications are not currently a feature.

### Ads and analytics

Sips’ app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.

No personal data is used to target Sips’ ads. Each ad collects, and shares with its advertiser, only three numbers: total views, total taps, and total subscriptions from the ad.

### Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish an increase in functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

### California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

### Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

### Information for European Union Customers

By using Sips and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

### International Transfers of Information

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

### Your Consent

By using Sips, you consent to our privacy policy.
